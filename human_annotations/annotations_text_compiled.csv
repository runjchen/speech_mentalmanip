I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?""
Person2: God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
Person1: I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
Person2: We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Person1: Oh, we totally have to."

Person2: I know.
Person1: If you went away, what would become of me?
Person2: I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
Person1: Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
Person2: I can't help it.
Person1: That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home."
85514417,1,,,,,,,,0,"Person1: All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
Person2: What?
Person1: Shoot to kill, I said.
Person2: I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Person1: Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Person2: Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
Person1: Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
Person2: If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience."
85514418,1,,0,,,,,,,"Person1: You're alive! She didn't kill you!
Person2: Who didn't?
Person1: That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
Person2: You love me?
Person1: My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
Person2: We have to have a long talk about all this.
Person1: I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower."
85514419,1,,,,,,,,0,"Person1: I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we were together you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
Person2: How do you know?
Person1: I just know. I know you'll love it.

Person2: I think it's what you think.
Person1: No, it isn't what I think.
Person2: Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary."
85514422,1,,,,1,,,,,"Person1: He's dead.
Person2: We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Person1: No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
Person2: Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
Person1: Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
Person2: I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Person1: No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Person2: Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
Person1: That's what I'm counting on.
Person2: But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Person1: Okay. If you think it will help."

Person2: I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Person1: You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Person2: Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Person1: Really? Can I see it?

Person2: Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
Person1: Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
Person2: Where?
Person1: Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
Person2: Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Person1: That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
Person2: Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
Person1: That's what I tried to find out.
Person2: You think my sister is there?
Person1: You can't tell.
Person2: Can we go there now?
Person1: Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
Person2: If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.

Person2: It's not really important.
Person1: Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Person2: Why are you being so dramatic?
Person1: Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Person2: Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot."

Person2: Of course not.
Person1: It would just be helpful to know.
Person2: No.
Person1: Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
Person2: I'm just preoccupied.
Person1: Do you like my new look?
Person2: Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Person1: I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Person2: Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Person1: Really?
Person2: Sure. Of course.

Person2: I noticed you've been pushing yourself too hard lately and thought you could use a break.
Person1: That wasn't your decision to make.
Person2: I’m only doing this for your own good. Sometimes you need someone to force you to take a step back.
Person1: I appreciate your concern, but I need to make those decisions for myself."

Person2: It's true.

Person2: Oh, that? It's not a big deal. Everyone knew you were a part of it.
Person1: That's not the point. It's about acknowledgment and respect.
Person2: You're making a mountain out of a molehill.
Person1: Proper credit is basic professionalism, Derek.

Person1: They saw you kill the driver.
Person2: You're up on your details, aren't you?
Person1: You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.

Person2: What?
Person1: This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
Person2: You don't trust me?
Person1: I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment."

Person2: Interest? Are you sure you're not mixing me up with someone else? I think you might be mistaken.
Person1: I distinctly remember you promising, and I could use that money now.
Person2: I wish I could help, but I don't recall that ever happening. Maybe it was someone else who borrowed from you.

Person1: That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know ""niggers"" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
Person2: I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
